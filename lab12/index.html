        <h1>Challenge</h1>
        <p>In this lab, I need to deal with conditionals, which is making the program act differently based on the different situations. Most of the tasks (including the bonus tasks) are easy since I already learnt this and used it a lot when I was working on Lab 7.
        <br><br>
        For the bonus tasks, I didn't do the first one, I thought it was a bit easy. For the second and the third tasks, they were pretty easy as well with the help of the hints from Wes. I simply just put the house names into an array called "houses", and replace the constant number "4" with the "houses.length" so that if I want to add more houses to the array, the divisor changes automatically. I also used houses[mod] to replace the long "if" conditionals. For the fourth task, I didn't do what Wes suggested in the assignment description, which is using checksum or hash. What I did was I collected the order numbers of letters, in alphabetical order, of the user input and added them up to replace the original "str.length". For example, if the user input is "Wes", then 47 will be divided by "houses.length".
        <br><br>
        I also add an if statement to check if the users actually put in anything or not before they hit the submit button. If the input field is empty, "Please enter your name first." will show in red, otherwise the program runs as normal.
