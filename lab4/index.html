			<h1>Challenge</h1>
				<p>Create pseudocodes for tasks. Get used to how to think like a programmer, that I need to come up with pseudocodes, then turn them to guidelines to help myself when actually programming.</p>

		<div class="block">
			<h1>Problems</h1>
				<p>Everything worked properly. I had no problems completing this lab.</p>

			<h1>Results</h1>
			<h3>Here's the outllines:</h3>
			<p>
				<pre>
				Pseudocode of Everyday Task:
					How to order food on Ubereat:
					1.Decide what you want to eat.
					2.Find that restaurant on Ubereat.
					3.Add all the food you want to the shopping cart.
					4.Pay for the food.

				Pseudocode of Computer Task:
					How to create a 3D model for a game:
					1.Find concept art images that shows the appearence of the object.
					2.Open Maya (or any other 3D modeling software).
					3.Make high resolution mesh, include all the details that show on the concept art.
					4.Make low resolution mesh that matches the silhouette of the high resolution mesh.
					5.Edit the UV map of the low-res mesh.
					6.Export the low-res mesh from Maya to Substance Painter to bake normal map and AO map.
					7.Create textures for the mesh.
					8.Export the low-res mesh and its textures to a game engine like UE.
					9.Put the mesh into the scene and apply material for it using the textures.
					</pre>
